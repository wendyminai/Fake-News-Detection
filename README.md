# Fake-News-Detection
In this data science project,  I use Python as a model to assess if a news report is accurate or false. To carry out this, I created a TfidfVectorizer classifier and then used the PassiveAggressiveClassifier to identify the news into a ‘True’ and ‘False.’ There will be a 7796×4 shaped dataset, and all these will be executed in the JupyterLab.
